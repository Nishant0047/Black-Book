Part 1: Data Ingestion & Normalization

Goal:Build backend modules that can collect, parse, and normalize logs or data feeds.

Includes:

1. Basic Python/Node scripts to read system/network logs
2. Connect to threat intel APIs (like OTX or MISP)
3. Normalize log structure (timestamp, source IP, type, severity, etc.)
4. Store in temporary local storage or in-memory

---

Part 2: Database Design & Storage Layer

Goal:Design the database and implement how data is stored efficiently.

Includes:

1. Choose and set up DB (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch)
2. Design schema for:
  i. Raw logs
  ii. Threat indicators
  iii. Alert events
3. Build scripts to insert/read from DB
4. Ensure data is clean and indexed

---

Part 3: Threat Detection & Correlation Engine

Goal: Apply logic to identify known threats or suspicious patterns.

Includes:

1. Match logs with threat feeds (indicator-based detection)
2. Implement simple rules (e.g., failed login attempts > 5)
3. Tag logs as “suspicious”, “malicious”, or “safe”
4. Build correlation logic for multi-step threats (optional for advanced version)

---

Part 4: Backend API Development

Goal: Build a RESTful API for frontend to interact with processed data.

Includes:

1. Use Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js)
2. Create endpoints:

  i. `/logs` → View logs
  ii. `/alerts` → View threat alerts
  iii. `/stats` → Show counts/summary
3. Secure API with CORS, rate-limiting, and token-based access

---

Part 5: Frontend Dashboard (Basic UI)

Goal:Build an interactive dashboard for visualizing logs and alerts.

Includes:

1. Use React (or simple HTML/CSS/JS if preferred)
2. Pages:

  i. Home (dashboard summary)
  ii. Logs (with filters)
  iii. Alerts (highlighted)
3. Integrate with backend API
4. Simple charts (pie chart, bar graph for threat types)

---

Part 6: Advanced UI & Alerting System

Goal: Make UI rich and add real-time alerting.

Includes:

1. Add D3.js, Chart.js or Recharts for advanced visualizations
2. Heatmap of threats by region or time
3. Add alert sound, popups, or color codes
4. Export logs/alerts as PDF/CSV
5. Real-time update with polling or WebSocket

---

Part 7: Containerization & Deployment

Goal: Package everything using Docker and deploy locally or on cloud.

Includes:

1. Write Dockerfiles for backend, frontend, and DB
2. Docker Compose to run all services together
3. Test everything end-to-end
4. Optional: Deploy on AWS/GCP or any server
5. Add README, docs, user guide
